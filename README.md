# Lab 06 

## Lab 6a.
Construction and visualization of three-dimensional objects.
The implementation of this work is aimed at consolidating the theoretical material and practical mastering of the basic methods and algorithms of three-dimensional visualization.

#### A task:
Write an application / web application in which a given three-dimensional object (wireframe) is formed and rendered.

#### Options:
A three-dimensional image of the first letter of the surname is taken as a three-dimensional object.

## Lab 6b.
Implementation of three-dimensional transformations.

#### A task:
Complement the application / web application by implementing three-dimensional transformations of a given object (scaling, translation, rotation around an arbitrary axis).

## Lab 6c.
Construction of the simplest projections.
#### Task: Supplement the application / web application by implementing the construction of three orthographic projections of a given object (on the coordinate planes Oxy, Oxz, Oyz).

Requirements and evaluation criteria:
* To define a three-dimensional object, use an array with the coordinates of the vertices.
* Graphical interface (coordinate system, axes)
* When performing 3D transformations, output the final transformation matrix.
